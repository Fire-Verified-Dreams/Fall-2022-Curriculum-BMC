# Unit 1 Lab: Combining it All

## Purpose

Over the past several lessons of this unit, you've learned so much about HTML and CSS. In today's lesson, you'll bring everything you learned together to build a portfolio template, including Flexbox, responsive design, and the box model.

## Directions

1. Use the wireframes linked [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ADfWxBFZ5UHHUrd3ZwFuhr/Combining-It-All-Lab?node-id=0%3A1) to build a portfolio template. The wireframes will give you an idea of how things should be laid out, but you should feel free to play around with colors and other styles.
2. The wireframes include two pages:
  * A main landing page, with a header, and a Navbar
  * An "About" page with an image gallery
3. Each page includes designs for both desktop and mobile. Your site should be responsive and automatically adjust based on the size of the device. (Use 768px as the breakpoint size).

## Features
  * Responsive Navbar
  * Responsive Landing page
  * Response Image Gallery Page
  * Customization and Tweaking
