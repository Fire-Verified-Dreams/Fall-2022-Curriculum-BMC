# Lesson 0: Semantic HTML/CSS

You know how to manage coding projects using the CLI, Git, and Github â€” let's start building some stuff!

## Agenda:
* 0:00 - 

## Objectives
Fellows will...
* Structure HTML using HTML5 semantic tags
* Understand the difference between semantic and non-semantic HTML and CSS
* Be able to articulate the benefits of writing semantic code.
* Open, edit, and preview and HTML file their browsers

## Demo - Thinking in HTML
* HTML and CSS are languages that we can write in files, just like JavaScript. If you open those files in a browser, it will render that code **visually**! 
* We can open up any webpage and right-click and "Inspect" to see the HTML and CSS that powers them.
* All of the content that you see is either text (`<p>` or `<h1>`), an image (`<img>`), or a link to another page (`<a>`).
* All content in HTML is inside an invisible box (or nested inside many boxes)! Originally, all of these boxes were created using "divisions" (`<div>`).

## Semantic HTML
* https://www.reddit.com/ --> Right click and "Inspect"
* HTML5 (the most current version) added Semantic Tags.
* Semantic Tags are more _expressive_ divisions. They are still boxes but they convey additional meaning.  
* Structurally semantic tags include: `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`
* Other new semantic tags include: `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, `<blockquote>` 
* Lastly, we are very familiar with the following semantic tags: `<p>`, `<h1>`...`<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`
* Non-semantic tags: `<div>`, `<span>`, `<b>`, `<i>`
  * These tags don't give any information about what's inside.
* Why Semantics are dope:
  1. More readable code. Very helpful when working on teams.
  2. Accessibility. Screen readers can better navigate websites written in semantic HTML.
  3. Semantic HTML is search-engine optimized. Search engines can better recognize key parts of your website when they are signaled with semantic HTML. This could help in the search rankings.
  4. Makes styling easier/more efficient. When you target elements based on the structure and meaning of their content _instead_ of how it appears, it will be easier to make uniform style changes to like elements in the future.

## Lecture: Code-a-Long - Our Landing Page Mockup
* We will recreate [our Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx) together! But we can make some fun styling changes along the way!
* We will download the [Page Ruler Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-ruler/jcbmcnpepaddcedmjdcmhbekjhbfnlff/related?hl=en) to get precise pixel measurements.
* We will use the following elements in our page:
* We will also download the [Eye Dropper Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka) to find exact colors.

### Our Process
0. Open up https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx. Without inspecting the HTML, try to visually identify each of the elements listed in the structure below.
1. Start by imagining the boxes and use semantic elements to create a structure. Then, you can fill in the content elements (text, pictures, links). We will use this structure:
  * `body`
    * `main`
      * `h1`
      * `p`
      * `figure`
        * `img`
        * `figcaption`
      * `section`
        * `h2`
        * `ul`
          * A bunch of `li` elements. (**be sure to target juice with an `id`**)
      * `blockquote`
        * `p`
        * `cite` 
      * `h2` and `a`
2. Create a file called `index.html` to write this structure. 
3. Be mindful of spacing and indentation!
4. Code a little, test a little. Use the "Preview" button to see your rendered HTML. Then pop it out into a new window.
5. Style the page
  * Set the background color of the `body`
  * Set width of `main`
  * Set `section` and `article` to `display: inline-block`
  * Set `section` and `article` to `max-height: fill-available`
  * Set background colors

## CSS
**CSS** is the language used to add style (color, font, spacing) to the elements of a website. CSS is typically written in `.css` files and referenced by `.html` files using the `<link>` tag. 

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

> CSS can also be written directly into `.html` files when placed inside `<style>` tags or as inline styles.

**CSS selectors** and **CSS properties** are used to target HTML elements and define style rules for the selected elements to follow. The syntax is as follows:

```css
selector {
  property-name: property-value;
}
```

There are many ways to select HTML elements for styling but the three most common ways are:
* By tag name: `p { color: blue; }`
* By `.class` name `.red-text { color: red; }`
* By `#id` name `#special { color: purple; }`

Some CSS properties to get started with are:

Color:
* [`color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color)
* [`background`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background)

Text:
* [`font-family`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family)
* [`font-size`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size)
* [`line-height`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height)
* [`text-align`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align)

Box Model:
* [`width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width)
* [`height`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height)
* [`padding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding)
* [`border`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border)
* [`margin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin)
  
## Vocabulary

#### HTML
HTML is the language used to create the **structure** and **content** of a website. HTML is written and stored in `.html` files and rendered by browsers.

#### HTML Tags
HTML tags are pieces of HTML code that create either structure or content on a website. They all have a name and are written using angle brackets (`<>`). 

Most HTML tags have an _opening_ and a _closing_ tag with content or other HTML tags nested inside. For example, a paragraph tag looks like this:

```html
<p>This is shown as text</p>
```

Some HTML tags are _self closing_, meaning they don't require a closing tag. In this case, `/>` is used instead of `>`. For example, an image can be created like this:

```html
<img src="url-to-img.jpg"/>
```

#### Elements

We refer to HTML tags that are rendered by the browser as _HTML Elements_. For example, the HTML tag `<p>some text</p>` creates an HTML text element.

#### Semantic HTML tags

HTML tags are tags that convey additional meaning about the element that they create beyond physical appearance alone. Structurally semantic tags include: `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`, `<main>`
* Other new semantic tags include: `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, `<blockquote>` 
* Lastly, we are very familiar with the following semantic tags: `<p>`, `<h1>`...`<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`

#### Non-Semantic tags

Non-semantic tags do not convey any additional meaning and do not provide context for what content they contain. Non-semantic tags include:
* `<div>`, `<span>`, `<b>`, `<i>`

#### Structural elements vs. content elements

We can think of HTML elements as either displaying content (content elements) or providing structure for content (structural elements). 

Structural tags might include:
* `<div>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, etc...

Content tags might include:
* `<p>`, `<img>`, `<h1>`, `<a>`

#### Child Elements and Parent Elements

HTML elements can be _nested_ inside one another. This is how we create structure. When we nest one element inside another, the inside element is known as the _child_ element and the outside element is the _parent_ element.

In this example below, the box created by `<div>` is the parent element while the text created by `<p>` is the child element.

```html
<div id='parent'>
  <p>This text is a child</p>
</div>
```

#### CSS

CSS is the language used to add style (color, font, spacing) to the elements of a website. CSS is typically written in `.css` files and referenced by `.html` files using the `<link>` tag. CSS can also be written directly into `.html` files when placed inside `<style>` tags or as inline styles.

#### CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements for the purpose of defining style rules for the selected elements to follow. There are many ways to select HTML elements for styling but the three most common ways are:
* By tag name
* By `class` name
* By `id` name

```css
p {
  color: blue;
}
.redText { 
  color: red;
}
#specialParagraph {
  color: purple;
}
```
