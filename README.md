## **Learning Principles**
---

- **Go slow now to go far later.**
    - Mastery of the fundamentals takes time but it is worth it.
    - If you understand the fundamentals, you can reason about any of the abstractions built on top of them.
- **Your words are your world.**
    - Vocabulary matters. Your mental models can only be as strong as the language you have to describe them.
    - The quality of your solution is determined by your ability to articulate the problem.
- **Learning is a skill...**
    - â€¦and it is the most important skill in the world.
    - ....and like all other skills, it can be developed and improved upon with intentional practice.
    - We learn by repeated exposure. ****What was once intimidating becomes familiar and approachable through repetition.
