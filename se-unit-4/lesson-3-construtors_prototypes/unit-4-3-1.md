* What is prototypal inheritance and how does it differ from class-based inheritance seen in object-oriented languages?


#### The WHY

![cookie cutters](img/cookie_cutters.png)

Factory functions are functions that return objects with a consistent structure (the same set of properties and methods). Using factory functions, we can imitate a concept in Object-Oriented Programming called **constructor functions**.

With constructor functions, we define an object blueprint and the constructor function creates **instances** of that blueprint.

Factory functions and constructor functions are basically the same, but there are some technical details that distinguish them. Let's take a look.

## Factory Functions vs. Constructors

Factory functions have parameters and return an object that has properties and methods.
```js
function makeCar(make, model) {
    return {
        make: make,
        model: model,
        passengers: [],
        addPassenger(name) {
            this.passengers.push(name);
        },
    }
}

const myCar = makeCar("Chevy", "Cobalt");
myCar.addPassenger('ben');
myCar.addPassenger('motun');
myCar.addPassenger('carmen');
console.log(myCar);
```

Constructor function:
```js
function Car(make, model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.passengers = [];
    this.addPassenger = function(name) {
        this.passengers.push(name);
    }
}

const myCar = new Car("Chevy", "Cobalt");
myCar.addPassenger('ben');
myCar.addPassenger('motun');
myCar.addPassenger('carmen');
console.log(myCar);
```

**Q: What are the differences between this constructor function and this factory function?**

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

* The `Car` constructor function's name uses `PascalCase` (the first character of every word is uppercase)
* The `Car` constructor doesn't need to return anything.
* `new` operator is used.

</details>

### The `new` keyword

The `new` keyword does a lot for us:
* It creates a new empty object
* It sets `this` within the constructor to point to the new object
* It returns the new object from the constructor function

```js
function NumberHolder(num) {
    this.num = num;
}

const myObj = new NumberHolder(5);
//=> myObj â‰ˆ { num: 5 }
```

Here, `myObj` is assigned an object with a property `num` assigned the value `5`. This object was created and returned by the `NumberHolder` constructor. `myObj` is an instance of the `NumberHolder` constructor.

### String, Number, Boolean, Array, and Object constructors

Normally, we create data values using "literal" notation:

```js
let age = 27;               // Number literal 27
let name = "ben"            // String literal "ben"
let isInstructor = true;    // Boolean literal true
let nums = [1, 2, 3];       // Array literal [1, 2, 3]
let user = { id: 123 };     // Object literal { id: 123 }
```

Each of these data types also has a corresponding constructor function that we could use:

```js
let age = new Number(27);               // an instance of the Number constructor
let name = new String("ben")            // an instance of the String constructor
let isInstructor = new Boolean(true);   // an instance of the Boolean constructor
let nums = new Array(1, 2, 3);          // an instance of the Array constructor
let user = new Object();                // an instance of the Object constructor
user.id = 123;
```

> Note: We should avoid using these in most cases because it is a slower operation than using the literal notation.

The existence of these constructor functions illuminates an interesting fact about JavaScript data values: **everything is an object**.

## Prototypes

Key Terms:

* Prototype
* Inherit
* `Constructor.prototype`

When we create an array literal, under the hood we are using the `Array` constructor function. This creates our array as an _instance_ of the `Array` constructor.

```js
const letters = new Array('a', 'b', 'c');
// const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
```

The array `letters` has its own properties `0: 'a'`, `1: 'b'`, `2: 'c'` and it _inherits_ properties from the `Array.prototype` such as `push`.

```js
console.log(Array.prototype);
```

A **prototype** is an "ancestral" object from which properties and methods are inherited. Every constructor has a `Constructor.prototype` property storing this object (like `Array.prototype` amd `String.prototype` and our own constructors, `Car.prototype` and `NumberHolder.prototype`).

Go ahead, print out the prototype object of any constructor function you know (or one you've created) to see what that object looks like!

```js
console.log(Object.prototype);
console.log(Car.prototype);
console.log(NumberHolder.prototype);
```

### Proto and Protoype properties

Key Terms:

* `Object.getPrototypeOf(instance)`
* `instance.__proto__` (deprecated)
* `instanceof` operator

The `[[Prototype]]` property of any object points to the `prototype` object of the constructor it was created by.

```js
const arr = [1,2,3];
console.log(arr); // look for the [[Prototype]] property (its greyed out)
```

In code, the `Object.getPrototypeOf` method is how we can reference this object directly. It accepts any object.

> We can also use the deprecated `obj.__proto__` property

```js
const arr = [1,2,3];
Object.getPrototypeOf(arr)  // => Array.prototype
arr.__proto__               // => Array.prototype, don't use this
```

The `instanceof` operator can tell us if an object descends from a  particular prototype.

**Q: What do each of these expressions return?**

```js
const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
const numbers = new Array(1,2,3);

letters instanceof Array
numbers instanceof Array

Object.getPrototypeOf(letters) === Array.prototype
Object.getPrototypeOf(numbers) === Array.prototype

// don't do this
letters.__proto__ === Array.prototype
numbers.__proto__ === Array.prototype
```

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

All of these expressions return `true`

</details>

### Prototypal Inheritance Chain

* Prototypal Inheritance Chain
* `Object.hasOwnProperty`

An object's prototype may also have a prototype that it inherits from, creating a **prototypal chain of inheritance**. `Array.prototype` has its own prototype: the `Object.prototype` object.

```js
Object.getPrototypeOf(Array.prototype) === Object.prototype
```

When we try accessing a property of an object, the JavaScript engine will look first at the object to see if it has that property. If it doesn't, it will look at the object's prototype and then its prototype (and so on...) until it finds the property.

This means that all arrays also inherits properties from `Object.prototype` such as `hasOwnProperty` and `toString`. 

`hasOwnProperty` is a method we can use to see which prototype a provided property belongs to:

```js
const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
// letters --> Array --> Object

letters.hasOwnProperty('0');                // true
letters.hasOwnProperty('length');           // true
letters.hasOwnProperty('push');             // false (push is on Array.prototype)
letters.hasOwnProperty('hasOwnProperty');   // false (hasOwnProperty is on Object.prototype)

Array.prototype.hasOwnProperty('push');             // true
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty('hasOwnProperty');  // true
```

The prototypal inheritance chain enables objects to use properties of its prototypal ancestors. In the example above `letters` can use the `hasOwnProperty` method because `letters` descends from `Array.prototype` which descends from `Object.prototype`.

### The end of the prototypal chain

`Object.prototype` descends from `null` which ends the prototypal chain. 

```js
Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype)
```

If JavaScript is looking for a property in an object's prototypal chain of inheritance and reaches `null`, it gives up and returns `undefined`.

```js
const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
console.log(letters.blah);
```

**Q: This returns `undefined`. Why?**

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

This returns `undefined` because the `blah` property is not an "own" property of `letters` or any of its protytpal ancestors.

</details>

**Q: What will the following code print?**

```js
const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
const numbers = new Array(1,2,3);

console.log(letters instanceof Object); // ??
console.log(numbers instanceof Object); // ??
```

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

`true` is printed twice.

`letters` and `numbers` are instances of the `Array` constructor which is an instance of the `Object` constructor.

</details>

### Changing the prototype chain

Key Terms:
* `Object.setPrototypeOf(instance)`

We can manually change an element's prototype using the `Object.setPrototypeOf()` method.

```js
let parent = { favoriteFruit: 'mango' }
let child = { }
Object.setPrototypeOf(child, parent)

console.log(child.favoriteFruit) // 'mango'

child.favoriteFruit = 'kiwi'

console.log(child.favoriteFruit) // 'kiwi'

console.log(parent.favoriteFruit) // 'mango'

delete child.favoriteFruit

console.log(child.favoriteFruit) // ??

parent.favoriteFruit = 'pear'

console.log(child.favoriteFruit) // ??
```
