## Event-Driven DOM Manipulation

> When [some event] happens, I want to manipulate the DOM [in some way]

## Documentation
- [`addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
- [event types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)
- [`event` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event)

## Practice

- For most of your Unit 5 work, you will not start with a blank HTML. Instead, you will code out an HTML file of what your initial DOM should look like and the use JavaScript Events to dynamically manipulate the DOM!

### Coding Activities
1. Building a Dice-rolling app
2. Building a Keyboard tracker
3. Managing events for multiple elements
