# Auth

**Authentication** and **authorization** are two different concepts related to security and access control. 
* **Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity.
* **Authorization** is the process of determining what resources or actions a user is allowed to access or perform.

## The Template Repo

We are going to be working with [this template repo](https://github.com/The-Marcy-Lab-School/auth-example-bcyrpt-sessions) which will be available for you to use as a starting point for your project. 
* You are NOT expected you to build this from scratch. You are expected to be able to build on top of it.
* It will take time to understand the details. To start, we are hoping for you to understand the high-level picture. To help break it down, consider the 4 main user flows:
  1. Creating a new account
  2. Logging into an existing account
  3. Viewing a home page with information that only logged-in users can see (requires authentication)
  4. Viewing a user profile page where you can update your profile (requires authorization)

## Routes

This auth example uses the following routes defined in `src/routes.js`. In `src/server.js`, we can see that this `Router` is used on all routes starting with `api/`



```js
/* src/server.js */
  const routes = require('./routes.js');
  app.use('/api', routes);

/* src/routes.js */

  // Create
  Router.post('/users', userController.create);
  Router.post('/users/login', userController.login);

  // Read
  Router.get('/users', userController.list);
  Router.get('/users/:id', userController.show);
  Router.get('/me', userController.showMe);

  Router.get('/logged-in-secret', checkAuthentication, (req, res) => {
    res.send({ msg: 'The secret is: there is no secret.' });
  });

  // Update
  Router.patch('/users/:id', checkAuthentication, userController.update);

  // Delete
  Router.delete('/users/logout', userController.logout);

  module.exports = Router;
```

Note that `checkAuthentication` is a middleware function that is manually applied to the `GET /logged-in-secret` and `PATCH /users/:id` routes. 

## Cookies

In the context of computing and the internet, a cookie is a small text file that is sent by a website to your web browser and stored on your computer or mobile device. 

Cookies contain information about your preferences and interactions with the website, such as login information, shopping cart contents, or browsing history.

When you visit the website again, the server retrieves the information from the cookie to personalize your experience and provide you with relevant content.

> ⚠️ It's worth noting that while cookies are generally harmless and serve useful purposes, they can also be used for malicious purposes such as tracking your personal information or spreading malware.

### The cookie-session package

The `cookie-session` middleware module makes it incredibly easy to use cookies to store information about our user. 

```js
const cookieSession = require('cookie-session');

const Router = express.Router();

Router.use(cookieSession({
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
}));
```

> <details>
> <summary>🤔 What is SESSION_SECRET?</summary>
> 
> The `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable (see `.env`) is a static sequence of characters that only the server has access to (that's the point of environment variables after all). 
> 
> When the cookie `session` object is created by the server and sent back to the client, we will attach data to that object. We don't want that data to be easily readable so it is encoded using a hashing function. The `SESSION_SECRET` is used like a salt to transform the `session` data into an unreadable string. 
> 
> This value could be generated by mashing your keys, or it could be generated using a service like https://randomkeygen.com/. More secure applications would likely generate a new `SESSION_SECRET` value periodically to reduce the risk that the secret is spilled.
> </details>

With this middleware, all incoming Request objects will have a `req.session` property. We can add whatever data we want to it!

For example, let's put a `viewCount` on the `req.session` and increment it each time the user visits `/api/cookieCounter`. 

```js
Router.get('/cookieCounter', (req, res) => {
  const { session } = req;
  console.log(session); // an empty object at first
  session.viewCount = (session.viewCount || 0) + 1;
  console.log(session.viewCount);
  res.status(200).send({ count: session.viewCount });
});
```

Open the dev tools > Applications > Cookies and delete the cookie. Then refresh the page and you'll see that the `req.session.viewCount` has been reset!

### Storing User IDs on the Cookie for Authentication

In our application, we are using cookies to store the `userId` of the currently logged-in user. This will allow us to implement **authentication** (confirm that the user is logged in).

The flow of cookie data looks like this:

![](img/cookies-session-userid-diagram.svg)

## Fetch Logged-In User

The first user-flow we are going to look at to demonstrate how cookies are used is seeing if a user is already logged in.

In the UI, an authenticated user will see the <kbd>Profile</kbd> button in the navigation bar while an un-authenticated user will see the <kbd>Sign Up</kbd> and <kbd>Login</kbd> buttons.

Files Involved:
* **public/scripts/index.js** (invokes **global.js** functions `fetchLoggedInUser`)
* **public/scripts/global.js** (sends a `GET /api/me` request)
* **src/routes.js** (passes control to `userController.showMe`)
* **src/controllers/user/show-me.js** (checks the `session.userId`, finds the `user` (if present), and returns it)
* **src/db/models/user.js** (finds and returns the `user` from the DB)

If at the end of this process the client receives back the `user`, then the `setNav` function is invoked and we attempt to fetch the secret message that only logged-in users can see. 

All of the pages use this `fetchLoggedInUser` function to make some modification to the UI shown to the user. Explore how each page does it!

## Logging In

A user can log in when they visit the `/login.html` page. If the user is already logged in (using the `fetchLoggedInUser` function), they will immediately be redirected to the `/user.html` page

Files Involved:
* **public/scripts/login.js** (invokes **global.js** methods `signupAndLoginHandler` when the form is submitted)
* **public/scripts/global.js** (sends a `POST /api/users/login` request)
* **src/routes.js** (passes control to `userController.login`)
* **src/controllers/user/login.js** (finds the user by username, checks if the password is correct, sets the `session.id`, and sends the `user` to the client)
* **src/db/models/user.js** (finds and returns the `user` from the DB and uses `bcrypt` to verify the password)

If at the end of this process the client receives back a response without any errors, the user has successfully logged in and is redirected to `/user.html`.

## Creating an Account

A user can log in when they visit the `/login.html` page. If the user is already logged in (using the `fetchLoggedInUser` function), they will immediately be redirected to the `/user.html` page

Files Involved:
* **public/scripts/login.js** (invokes **global.js** methods `signupAndLoginHandler` when the form is submitted)
* **public/scripts/global.js** (sends a `POST /api/users/login` request)
* **src/routes.js** (passes control to `userController.login`)
* **src/controllers/user/login.js** (finds the user by username, checks if the password is correct, sets the `session.id`, and sends the `user` to the client)
* **src/db/models/user.js** (finds and returns the `user` from the DB and uses `bcrypt` to verify the password)

If at the end of this process the client receives back a response without any errors, the user has successfully logged in and is redirected to `/user.html`.

# Old garbage notes 
## Creating an Account [old]

Files Involved:
* public/create.html
* public/scripts/create.js
* public/scripts/global.js
* src/routes.js
* src/middleware/handle-cookie-sessions.js
* src/controllers/user/create.js
* src/db/models/user.js
* src/utils/

#### The client initiates the process

A user visits `/create` and enters their username and password. They click <kbd>Create User</kbd>.
* sends a `POST /api/users` request along with a `username` and `password` from the form.

#### The server receives the request to create a new user

<details><summary>The router invokes the <code>userController.create</code> method</summary>

```js
Router.post('/users', userController.create);
```
</details>

<details><summary>The controller invokes the model's <code>User.create</code> method which returns a <code>User</code> instance. The <code>user.id</code> is stored on the <code>session</code> and the <code>user</code> is sent to the client</summary>

```js
const createUser = async (req, res) => {
  const {
    session,
    db: { User },
    body: { username, password },
  } = req;

  const user = await User.create(username, password);
  session.userId = user.id;

  res.send(user);
};
```
</details>

<details><summary>The model hashes the password and stores the username and hashed password in the database. A <code>User</code> instance is made to nicely package the data (<code>userInstance.id</code> and <code>.username</code>) and provide methods for interacting directly with that <code>User</code> instance (<code>userInstance.update</code> and <code>.isValidPassword</code>).</summary>

```js
const knex = require('../knex');
const { hashPassword, isValidPassword } = require('../../utils/auth-utils');
class User {
  
  // other User methods
  
  static async create(username, password) {
    const passwordHash = await hashPassword(password);

    const query = `INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash)
      VALUES (?, ?) RETURNING *`;
    const { rows: [user] } = await knex.raw(query, [username, passwordHash]);
    return new User(user);
  }
}
```
</details>

#### The client receives the created user and stores the information in the form

* Refreshing the page will trigger `fetchLoggedInUser` which sends a `GET /api/me` request along with the same cookie to the server. 
* The server knows that the client is already logged in because of the `session.userId` value and sends the logged-in user back
* The client then renders the `/user` page


### Client Side

* 4 pages
  * `/create` - register an account
  * `/` - see primary resources (posts, pictures, etc...)
  * `/user` - user profile with log out button
  * `login` - log in
* Key fetching methods:
  <details><summary>Create - <code>signupAndLoginHandle</code></summary>

    * sends a `POST /api/users` request when creating a new user on the `/create` page along with a `username` and `password` from the form.
    * sends a `POST /api/users/login` request when logging in on the `/login` page along with a `username` and `password` from the form.

  </details>

  <details><summary>Read - <code>fetchLoggedInUser</code></summary>

    * sends a `GET /api/me` request which returns a `user` if signed in (the cookie sent to the server has a session id), or `null` if not.
    * sent when hitting the `/` page. If a user is signed in, show the <kbd>Profile</kbd> button in the nav. If not, show the <kbd>Login</kbd> and <kbd>Sign Up</kbd> buttons
    * sent when hitting the `/create` and `/login` pages. If a user is signed in, redirects to `/user`.
    * sent when hitting the `/users` page. If a user is NOT signed in, redirects to `/login`. If a user IS signed it, it uses the returned `user` object to store the `user.id` on the <kbd>Update Username</kbd> form as a `data-user-id` attribute.

  </details>
  <details><summary>Update - <code>updateUsernameHandler</code></summary>

    * sends a `PATCH /api/users/:userId` request along with the updated username.
    * sent when a user presses the <kbd>Update Username</kbd> button from `/user`.
  </details>
  <details><summary>Delete - <code>logoutHandler</code></summary>

    * sends a `DELETE /api/users/logout` request which only returns an error if something went wrong.
    * sent when a user presses the <kbd>Log Out</kbd> button from `/user`.
  </details>
    

### Server Side

* `index.js`
  * imports and starts `server.js`
* `server.js` 
  * imports and uses `routes.js` on all routes
  * imports and uses `handleCookieSessions` middleware on all routes
  * uses `express.json()` middleware on all routes
  * uses `express.static()` middleware on all routes
* `routes.js`
  * imports `userController`
  * imports and uses `addModels` middleware on all routes

  * defines CRUD routes 
* `src/middleware/handleCookieSessions`
* `src/middleware/check-authentication`
* `utils/auth-utils`

#### CRUD Flows
<details><summary> Creating a User on <code>/create</code></summary>
