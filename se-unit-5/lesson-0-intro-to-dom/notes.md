# Unit 5 Lesson 0: Into to the DOM

## Key Terms
* Document Object Model
* tree
* node
* text node
* element node

## Essential Questions
* What is the DOM and why must we learn to manipulate it?
* Which sort of engineers would work with the DOM most often?
* What tools can we use to visualize the DOM?
* What is the `document` object?
* How does the _tree_ data structure allow us to visualize relationships between elements in the DOM?

## Learning Changes
* We will be developing in VSCode and our local (Ubuntu) terminal.
* We will be using `Inspect` to view the `Elements` tab and the `Console`.
* `debugger` is your new best friend.

## Experimenting with our own DOM!
* Same set up as in previous units!
  * `index.html` links to any `styles.css` with a script tag to `index.js`
  * Open up your `index.html` in the browser
  * _Or_ use the Live Server VSCode Extention

### The `document` is a JavaScript Object
* So we can access and edit its properties like a regular object!

### The `document` is a Tree
* So we can access its children and traverse it like a tree!
